# multiplayer-game-websockets
A browser based multiplayer game built with web sockets

This is an experiment using web sockets to build a simple multiplayer game that updates the state of the game every 500 ms
This is not the efficient way of building a multiplayer game.
This is game is based on **Authoritative server** architecture i.e The server takes care of updating the state of the game

*Fully functional version of this will be deployed soon , i hope so æµª *
